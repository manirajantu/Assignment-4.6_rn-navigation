# React Native Navigation: Assignment

## Brief

In this assignment, you will use whatever you have learned in the lesson to make an attempt to create two other popular navigation components:

1. [Tab Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation)
1. [Drawer Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-based-navigation)

Recall the concept where each `Screen` lives within a `Stack`, and the `Stack` within a `Container`. In a Tab Navigation, each screen can function as a `Stack` that contains multiple `Screens` within it. In a Drawer Navigation, it is much straightforward.

This assignment will expose you to the Tab and Drawer navigation, which will be helpful for the scoping of your project by giving you an idea how it works.

## Part 1 - Tab Navigation

Excerpt from reactnavigation.org:

### Step 1; Create Tab Navigation RN Project

In the root directory, run this command to create a RN project:

```sh
$ expo init TabApp
```

When you run the command above, it will create a RN project along with git in place. Since we will be creating two RN projects. We can delete the `.git` folder in the RN project. Run the following command in the root directory to delete `.git` in the RN project.

```sh
$ rm -rf ./TabApp/.git
```

If the above command fails, try with `sudo`:

```sh
$ sudo rm -rf ./TabApp/.git
```

You may be prompted to enter administrator password.

### Step 2: Install Dependency

Run this command on Terminal to install the dependency via yarn.

``` sh
$ # change directory to RN project root folder
$ cd ./TabApp 

$ # install dependency
$ yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs 
```
### Step 3: Add code

Add the following code to your `App.js`:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs';

function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Home!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

function SettingsScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Settings!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Tab.Navigator>
        <Tab.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Tab.Screen name="Settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
      </Tab.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

```

## Part 2 - Drawer Navigation

### Step 1 - Create Drawer Navigation RN Project

Navigate to the root directory of this git repository to create a new project with similar command. Run the following command on Terminal:

```sh
$ expo init DrawerApp
```

Delete the `.git` folder the same as part 1.

```sh
$ rm -rf ./NavApp/.git
```

If the above command fails, try with `sudo`:

```sh
$ sudo rm -rf ./NavApp/.git
```

You may be prompted to enter administrator password.

### Step 2 - Install Dependencies

```sh
$ # change directory
$ cd ./DrawerApp
$ # install dependencies
$ yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/drawer
$ expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
```

Add `import 'react-native-gesture-handler';` at the entry JS file, which is also `App.js`.

### Step 3 - Add code

Add the following code in `App.js`

```js
import { createDrawerNavigator } from '@react-navigation/drawer';

const Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();

function MyDrawer() {
  return (
    <Drawer.Navigator>
      <Drawer.Screen name="Feed" component={Feed} />
      <Drawer.Screen name="Article" component={Article} />
    </Drawer.Navigator>
  );
}
```

## Part 3 (Optional) - Add Icon and Badge to Tab Navigation App

You may go back to the Tab Navigation project to explore adding icons and badge to it. Just follow the documentation [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation)
